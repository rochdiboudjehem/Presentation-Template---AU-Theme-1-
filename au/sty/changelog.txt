To do:
- In the title page, affiliation numbers are displayed using a serif font (but not regular superscripts).
- The title page is not very appropriate for class slides
  >> develop a proper version with appropriate macros for class name, major, and so on
- Integrate the macros developped for specific classes (IR1 & 2) :
  - Formatting for example text (words and expressions searched in an index),
  - Relative character size,
  - pgfplots,
  - Shadow added behind images,
  - Trim images (cf. MGN Kibana)
  - Coordinates inside image (to add text or shapes)
  - Change size of listing (add basicstyle={\tiny\ttfamily} in options)
  - ...
- Content:
  - Actually use the resize trick for wide tables (see RI class slides)
  - Problem with hyperlinks on image when compiling with XeLaTeX
- Font:
  - Could use Abadi font (cf. AU Doctoriales PDF)
